### Age Calculator

I created this Age Calculator as a part of my first task in the Future Interns program. In this project, the user can enter their date of birth, and the application will calculate:

* The total number of days the person has lived
* The exact date of their next birthday
* How many days are left until their next birthday

It is a user-friendly tool that helps you quickly find useful age-related information. You can explore the project by running it on a local development server using the link:
**[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)**

This project helped me understand the basics of JavaScript date functions, DOM manipulation, and improving the user interface. More improvements will be added in the future.
