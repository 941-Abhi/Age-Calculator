### Age Calculator

This is a simple and interactive Age Calculator web application developed as part of the **Code Alpha** project.

In this application, the user can enter their date of birth, and the website will show:

* The total number of days the person has lived
* The date of their next birthday
* How many days are left until the next birthday

It is easy to use and helps users find useful age-related details in just a few seconds. You can try running it locally at:
**[http://localhost:5173//](http://localhost:5173/)**

This project helped me improve my skills in working with dates using JavaScript and building a clean user interface.
